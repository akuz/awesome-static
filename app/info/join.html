        All clients, just like the service providers,
        also have a star rating and a feedback page.
        You can review them before accepting a
        reservation.

        You can set your primary work area by choosing
        your location on a map (or using a postcode)
        and specifying the maximum distance you are
        willing to travel to reach clients.

        We will take payments from the clients for you,
        which means you can accept all the major credit
        cards. The money will be deposited into
        your bank account a week after each 
        service appointment.

        Taking payment online also protects you from
        the clients not respecting their commitment,
        and provides additional check that you will
        be dealing with a creditworthy person,
        whos details we have on record.
