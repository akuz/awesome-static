        You can start your own business or just do some

        We will help you to create your own work schedule
        and manage client reservations in the time slots
        you allocate as working time.

    <p>
        All clients, just like the service providers,
        also have a star rating and a feedback page.
        You can review them before accepting a
        reservation.

        You can set your primary work area by choosing
        your location on a map (or using a postcode)
        and specifying the maximum distance you are
        willing to travel to reach clients.

    <div class="remote-separator-icon">
        <i class="fa fa-credit-card"></i>

    <p>
        We will take payments from the clients for you,
        which means you can accept all the major credit
        cards. The accumulated funds will be deposited
        to your account within a week of each service
        appointment on a rolling basis.
    </p>

    <div class="remote-separator-icon">
        <i class="fa fa-lock"></i>

    <p>
        Taking payment online also protects you from
        the clients not respecting their commitment,
        and provides additional check that you will
        be dealing with a creditworthy person,
        whos details we have on record.
