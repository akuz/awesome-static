    <h5><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> 
        I want to list my profile here!
    </h5>
    <p>
        Please open the <a href="/info/contact">contact us</a>
        page and visit our website to register as a professional.
        You will need to go through the process of 
        background and qualifications check before
        you can start working.
    </p>

    <h5><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> 
        How fast will I get the money I earn?
    </h5>
    <p>
        The funds will be transferred to
        your bank account a week after the
        appointment, provided the client
        didn't claim a refund, in which
        case we will need to take a longer
        time to investigate and make a
        decision on the claim. Your other
        unaffected payments will still
        be transferred after a week.
    </p>

    <h5><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> 
        Will I be employed by Awesome Treat&trade;?
    </h5>
    <p>
        No. We merely provide you with access to
        clients through our scheduling and booking
        services available in our app. You still have
        to pass our background and qualifications
        check though.
    </p>

    <h5><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> 
        Do I have to pay the taxes?
    </h5>
    <p>
        Yes, you have to pay taxes on the
        money your earn. By the end of the
        tax year, you will have to register
        as self-employed with HMRC and
        complete your tax return.
    </p>

    <h5><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> 
        Can you make me a working visa?
    </h5>
    <p>
        Sorry, no. You must already have
        permission to work in the location
        where you provide the services.
    </p>
